## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel (for initial data cleaning)

## Key Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed duplicates and missing values
   - Standardized column names
   - Handled outliers where necessary

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Summary statistics
   - Visualizations of key trends
   
3. **Insights and Recommendations:**
   - Identified customer segments
   - Analyzed campaign effectiveness

## How to Use This Repository
- Download the dataset if needed
- Run the Jupyter Notebook to explore the analysis
- Modify or extend the project as needed

## Future Improvements
- Apply machine learning models for predictive analysis
- Integrate Power BI for interactive dashboards
